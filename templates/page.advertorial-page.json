But one moment had her worried for her dogs’ health.<br\/><\/p><p>Her dogs had been scratching themselves for almost a year. One of the dogs she boarded had brought fleas into her home and had spread to her dogs. But one day it got so bad Letetia’s dogs were scratching non stop.<\/p><p>\"I was terrified since 2 of my dogs are allergic to fleas,\" Letetia said.<\/p><p>Millions of pet owners face a similar problem: <strong>Flea allergy has been on the rise over the past 10 years, with a 12.5 %increase in dogs.<\/strong>1 Her dogs were biting and scratching so much and Letetia became even more anxious. She was worried they might spread the fleas to other animals!<\/p><p>Once the fleas started, Letetia knew she had to take action.<\/p><p>Sadly, her dogs were still suffering. Her pets scratched and bit at their fur throughout the night, their whines keeping the entire household awake. The constant itching made it difficult for Letetia to feel like the loving pet owner she knew she was.<\/p><p>The invasion got so bad, she had to stop boarding dogs, worried that she was just putting them at risk of getting flea bites!<\/p><p>Finally, with no options left, Letetia decided to try some flea medication. So she started shopping around.<br\/><\/p><p>Unfortunately, <strong>flea medicine<\/strong> is very pricey for most Americans. For all 5 dogs, Linda would need to <strong>spend anywhere from $150 to $575 each month on flea medicine<\/strong>. Plus, flea medication requires regular reapplication to keep up with all the new fleas.<\/p><p>With no way to give her dogs relief, Letetia was <strong>faced with two options<\/strong>: spend her hard-earned money on expensive flea treatments, or continue to watch her beloved pets suffer.<\/p>",
